# Perfect Python Client

A Python SDK for defining and orchestrating data workflows with the Perfect platform.

## Installation

```bash
# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Quick Start

Here's a complete example - just 2 simple steps:

```python
from perfect.sdk import task, flow
import time

# 1. Define tasks and flows with decorators
@task(estimated_time=2000)
def extract_data():
    """Extract data from database"""
    print("Extracting data...")
    return {"records": 1000}

@task(estimated_time=3000)
def transform_data(data):
    """Clean and transform data"""
    print(f"Transforming {data['records']} records...")
    return {"clean_records": 950}

@flow(
    name="My ETL Pipeline",
    description="Extract, transform, and load daily data",
    tags={"version": "v1.0", "team": "data-eng"}
)
def my_etl():
    """Main ETL workflow"""
    data = extract_data()
    clean_data = transform_data(data)
    return clean_data

# 2. Call your flows - that's it!
if __name__ == "__main__":
    my_etl()  # SDK auto-connects, registers, and starts listening!

    # Keep script running
    while True:
        time.sleep(1)
```

**That's it!** Just 2 steps:
- ✅ **Define tasks and flows** using decorators
- ✅ **Call flows** - SDK automatically handles everything (connection, registration, listening, execution)

**Zero Configuration**: The SDK automatically:
- Connects to the backend when you call a flow
- Registers the flow with Perfect
- Starts listening for execution requests in background
- Handles execution and graceful shutdown
- Tracks task execution dynamically (supports loops, conditionals)
- Signals flow completion to the server

### Task Decorator Parameters

```python
@task(estimated_time=3000, crucial_pass=True)
```

**Parameters:**
- `estimated_time`: Expected duration in milliseconds (default: 1000)
  - Used for weight-based progress calculation
- `crucial_pass`: If True, task failure fails the entire flow (default: True)
  - Set to False for optional tasks that shouldn't stop the flow

### Flow Decorator Parameters

```python
@flow(
    name="My Flow",
    description="What this flow does",
    tags={"version": "v1.0", "team": "data-eng"}
)
```

**Parameters:**
- `name`: Human-readable flow name (required)
- `description`: What the flow does (optional)
- `tags`: Dictionary of metadata tags for organization (optional)
  - Example: `{"version": "v1.0", "team": "ml-ops", "priority": "high"}`

### Configuration (Optional)

By default, the SDK auto-connects to `http://localhost:3000` with client ID `perfect_example`.

To customize, use `configure()`:

```python
from perfect.sdk import configure

configure(
    backend_url="http://localhost:3000",  # Perfect backend URL
    client_id="my_custom_client",         # Unique client identifier
    mock=False                             # Set to True for testing without backend
)
```

Call `configure()` before calling any flows if you need custom settings.

### Listen Function

```python
listen()  # Start listening for execution requests
```

Call `listen()` after you've called all the flows you want to register. It:
- Ensures the client is connected (auto-connects if needed)
- Starts listening for execution requests from the Perfect UI
- Blocks until interrupted (Ctrl+C)
- Automatically shuts down gracefully

## Example Flows

The `client_example.py` includes 4 production-ready workflow examples:

1. **Daily Sales ETL** - Extract sales data, transform, and load to warehouse
2. **Churn Model Retraining** - ML pipeline for model training and deployment
3. **Infrastructure Health Check** - Monitor API and database health metrics
4. **Weekly Executive Report** - Generate and email PDF reports

## API Reference

### Decorators

#### `@task(name=None, estimated_time=1000, crucial_pass=True)`
Registers a function as a task.

**Parameters:**
- `name`: Human-readable task name (optional, defaults to function name)
- `estimated_time`: Expected duration in milliseconds (default: 1000)
- `crucial_pass`: If True, task failure fails the flow (default: True)

#### `@flow(name, description, schedule=None)`
Registers a function as a flow.

### Scheduling

#### `CronSchedule(expression)`
Cron-based scheduling:
```python
CronSchedule("0 0 * * *")      # Daily at midnight
CronSchedule("0 9 * * MON")     # Mondays at 9 AM
CronSchedule("*/15 * * * *")    # Every 15 minutes
```

#### `IntervalSchedule(expression)`
Interval-based scheduling:
```python
IntervalSchedule("*/5 * * * *")  # Every 5 minutes
```

## Dynamic Task Execution

Flows can have dynamic task structures based on runtime conditions:

```python
@flow(name="Dynamic ETL")
def dynamic_etl():
    # Tasks in loops - each iteration is tracked separately
    for source in ["sales", "inventory", "customers"]:
        extract_data(source)  # Creates 3 separate task instances

    # Conditional tasks - skipped tasks are removed from the run
    if needs_cleanup:
        cleanup_data()

    # Always runs
    load_to_warehouse()
```

The SDK:
- Tracks each task call as a separate task instance
- Sends task name and estimated time to the server
- Signals flow completion with actual task count
- Server removes any predefined tasks that weren't executed

## Parallel Flow Execution

Multiple flows can run in parallel using threads:

```python
import threading

threads = []
for flow_func in [flow1, flow2, flow3]:
    t = threading.Thread(target=flow_func)
    t.start()
    threads.append(t)

for t in threads:
    t.join()
```

Each flow runs with its own isolated execution context (thread-local storage).

## Integration with Perfect UI

Once flows are registered, they appear in the Perfect web dashboard where you can:

- ✅ View all registered flows and their tasks
- ⚡ Trigger flows manually with different configurations
- 📊 Monitor real-time execution progress
- 📝 View live task logs and metrics
- 📈 Track execution history and performance
- 📉 View task statistics (avg duration, std deviation, sample count)

## Next Steps

1. Modify `client_example.py` to add your own flows
2. Run the client to register flows with the engine
3. Open the Perfect UI to monitor and trigger executions
4. Build production workflows for ETL, ML, reporting, and more!
